- 👋 Hi, I’m @JSTAR-25
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the fundamentals of coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript & Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that I could learn more from
- 📫 How to reach me ...

Projects that I complete will be published here...

I am not sure how to fully utilize GitHub right now, but as I start completing courses I will most likely start getting to grips with it...I HOPE!!

Hopefully, I will see improvements in both my GitHub skills and coding skills as time progresses!
